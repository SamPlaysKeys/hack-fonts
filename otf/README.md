# OTF Directory

This directory is reserved for OpenType Font (.otf) versions of the Hack typeface.

## Status: Coming Soon

Currently, the official Hack font releases only provide TrueType Font (.ttf) formats. OTF versions may be added in the future through:

1. Official releases from the [source-foundry/Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack) repository
2. Conversion from TTF files using font conversion tools like FontForge
3. Community contributions

## Current Font Formats

For now, please use the following available formats:

- **TTF files**: Available in the `/ttf/` directory
- **Web fonts**: WOFF and WOFF2 files available in the `/web/` directory

## Contributing

If you have expertise in font conversion and would like to contribute OTF versions of the Hack fonts, please:

1. Ensure conversions maintain the quality and licensing of the original fonts
2. Follow the same naming conventions as the TTF files
3. Include proper attribution and licensing information
4. Submit a pull request or create an issue in the repository

For immediate font usage, please refer to the TTF files in the adjacent `ttf/` directory.
